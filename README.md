# Clients API

This was the first of the tests I implemented. I decided to use node/express to show any prospects to the company and the spot I am applying to.

I did a sepparate model/controller for the phones just to show some relationship between the models and complexity on the routing.

For the tests I used Mocha, simmulating the requests to the API.
